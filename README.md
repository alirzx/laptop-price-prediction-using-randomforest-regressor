# laptop-price-prediction-using-randomforest-regressor
This project aims to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications using machine learning. The dataset includes features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, screen resolution, GPU, and more. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the price of a laptop given its features.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., One-Hot Encoding), and extracting useful features (e.g., screen resolution, CPU speed).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the relationships between features and the target variable (price) using visualizations and statistical summaries.

Model Building: Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor) to predict laptop prices.

Validation and Testing: Evaluate the model's performance using validation and testing sets, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.

Tools and Libraries:
Python

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (machine learning)

Outcome:
The final model provides a reliable prediction of laptop prices, which can be used by consumers to compare prices or by retailers to set competitive pricing strategies. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios, emphasizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
